# LC-CourseSchedule

Alternate Studio for Class 2 of CoderGirl Front End (November 2020)
Create two lists of fictitious LC courses - allow student to select from available courses and add to their own list.
Bonus missions include better UX with limits on credit hours, conditional classes for visual cues, glyphicons, etc.

Instructions for students to start from scratch are here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x05a_Fag2IXRGv4KlOaIdFcZnexPgOCpkCXE73qibj4/edit?usp=sharing

See **course-solution** branch to view finished code for the project setup and course component, along with some comments. 

The schedule component will be completed at a later date.
